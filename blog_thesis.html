  <div class="section__content">
    <div>At the end of March, I defended my Master's thesis at Bocconi University on <b>algorithmic accountability in the public sector</b>, written 
    under the supervision of Professor Pollicino. The road to this day was not a short one: I started working on the thesis while working for 
    Digital Policy Alert, and then finished it while working at the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation. Anyone who has had to write 
    their thesis while working knows that it is not trivial. You have an ever-present thought about the reading, thinking, and writing you 
    should be doing, but your time is filled with other commitments. On top of that, it can be hard when you are doing research in the fast-moving 
    field of digital policy (think of the developments on the AI Act in these months). But in the end, everyone finds their way through.
    <br><br>
    Now, a few months after finishing my research and with a new job title in a much different sector, I am returning to my dissertation. I want 
    to turn it from a 20k something piece into a paper half the size. I'm going through it, re-reading key references, adding new ones and building 
    on them, and trying to draw a clearer line from the beginning to the end. Its key message goes like: (i) algorithms are and will be increasingly 
    used in the public sector to automate decision making, (ii) accountability is the most important feature of ADMS, but probably also the one whose 
    meaning is most blurred, (iii) understanding how to ensure it is fundamental, and many policy solutions have been proposed: my thesis identifies 
    them to enable clearer policy choices.
    <br><br>
    You can find the slides from my thesis discussion <a href="PARAZZOLI - Thesis Presentation.pdf">here</a>. Below is the (rather long) abstract 
    that introduced my thesis.
    <br><br>
    <em>Algorithms are disrupting our societies, changing the way we communicate, analyse the world, conduct business, and make decisions of any kind. With the ambition of embracing their benefits, governments are increasingly adopting these technologies to improve their activity. Still, their implementation demonstrated that they can be source of relevant problems and breach the rule of law. In the first chapter of the thesis, an assessment of benefits and risks of algorithms is presented. In particular, the former are analysed through the lens of public value and evaluated in terms of their ability to improve efficiency, service delivery quality, trust and legitimacy, and outcome achievement. The discussion on the latter is opened with a case study on the Ofqual case that took place in the UK in 2020. Following this, the risks that the use algorithms in the public sector are considered and found to be revolving around transparency, fairness, and accountability. This leads to acknowledging that the risks predominantly have to do with automated decision-making system (ADMS). Lastly, it is claimed that governments currently have an open regulatory window of opportunity. The pervasive diffusion of algorithm just started and adequate legal frameworks to ensure that their benefits and risks are optimally balanced and their complexity considered are lacking. In this context, policymakers should acknowledge that a moment of closure will probably come soon, and after that moment regulatory changes will be increasingly unlikely.
    <br><br>
    The recognition of the risks of implementing ADMS in the public sector has led to the emergence and widespread use of the concept of algorithmic accountability, which is regarded as fundamental to the responsible implementation of ADMS. However, in order to ensure its respect, it is necessary to understand exactly what algorithmic accountability means in the public sector. This is what the second chapter of the thesis aims to do. Studies aimed at bridging principles and policies are lacking. Furthermore, efforts focused on transparency and fairness have proven to be limited in their ability to ensure the safe implementation of ADMS. Therefore, it is important to study algorithmic accountability in the public sector and, first of all, to study what exactly it is. In the chapter, it is argued that this concept can be seen as the intersection of public accountability and algorithmic accountability, and these two concepts are studied. In this way, the chapter provides a new lens through which to examine algorithmic accountability in the public sector, allowing for a deeper understanding of it beyond the claims made in policy forums, and connects this debate to the literature on public accountability, enabling an appreciation of algorithmic accountability in the light of the variability and complexity of ADMS in the public sector.
    <br><br>
    Against the problem that ADMSs can result in worrisome deficits of accountability, policymakers can adopt so-called algorithmic accountability policies, namely those policies aimed at ensuring that those that design, procure, and use ADMS are answerable for their impacts. To understand what policies are on the palette of policymakers, the third chapter provides an original algorithmic accountability policies mapping. The mapping is structured around a lifecycle of the ADMS, which is identified combining state-of-the-art AI lifecycles and the policy cycle. Every policy in the mapping has its own advantages, disadvantages, creates winners and losers, and works as constraint to agents’ behaviour. To assess which policy or combination of policies is optimal, one must be able to evaluate their results in light of certain criteria. Still, the effectiveness of a system is not easy to assess because these criteria are intrinsically political. Nonetheless, some tools can help to measure the success of algorithmic accountability policies, such as the accountability cube, empirical examination of regulatory practices, and techniques from the science of complexity. By taking into consideration the intricate web of connections between various agents and components, and the sociotechnical nature of the system, it suggested that it will be possible to achieve the ultimate objective of these efforts, that is to guarantee the responsible use of ADMSs in the public sector, ensuring that their adoption does not infringe accountability.</em>
